# Algorithm for optimization and model fitting

This algorithm can be found in the article Cantó, J., Curiel, S., and  Martínez-Gómez, E. "A simple algorithm for optimization and model fitting: AGA (asexual genetic algorithm)." A&A, vol. 501, no. 3, July 2009, pp. 1259-1268, https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/200911740

## How to use

The algorithm for finding global maximum of a multiparameter function is in the file `aga.py`. To test the code with an  model fitting example use the module `sed.py`, together with the data in `data.txt` and `error.txt`.
